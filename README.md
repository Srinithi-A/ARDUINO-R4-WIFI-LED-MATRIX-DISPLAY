# ARDUINO R4 WIFI LEDMATRIX SCROLLING TEXT

An IoT/Arduino beginner-friendly project using the Arduino R4 WiFi, the first Arduino board made in India 🇮🇳. I purchased the board and experimented with it for a week, creating a festive Diwali greeting displayed as scrolling text on the built-in LED matrix.

📌 Project Ideation:

During my exploration of the Arduino R4 WiFi capabilities, I wanted a small, beginner-friendly project that combined IOT, graphics, and a festive theme. The idea was to use the LED matrix to display a scrolling message for Diwali, showcasing both static and dynamic text with adjustable scroll speed.

📌 Key Features:

⏱ Adjustable scroll speed for smooth animation.
🖥 Built entirely using ArduinoGraphics & Arduino_LED_Matrix libraries.
🧑‍💻 Beginner-friendly code, easy to modify for other messages or events.

📌 Tech Stack:

Hardware:
Arduino UNO R4 WiFi (first Indian-made Arduino board 🇮🇳)

Software:
Arduino IDE
ArduinoGraphics & Arduino_LED_Matrix libraries

📌 How it Works:

Arduino R4 WiFi initializes the LED matrix.
Displays static text for a brief period.
Scrolls the festive “Happy Diwali!” message from right to left.
Users can adjust scroll speed and font size easily via code.
